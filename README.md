# vdom.js

This repository contains the code for [Let's build a virtual DOM library!](https://blog.structuredthoughts.dev/lets-build-a-virtual-dom-library)

The code is organised by chapter, so you can see what the code looks like at the end of each chapter and make your own modifications. The final code is in the `final` folder.
